# IncomePredicator

Using a dataset ( the "Adult Data Set") from the UCI Machine-Learning Repository the IncomePredicator can predict based on a number of factors whether o not someone's income will be greater than $50,000. 

In the initial (top level) design, we worry about the “big picture” approach to solving
the problem. We describe what data structures we need and what “big” processing steps we
might take along the way.
