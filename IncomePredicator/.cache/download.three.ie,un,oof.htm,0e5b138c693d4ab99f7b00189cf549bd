<strong>Out of Credit.</strong><br/><br/>
Why I'm here?<br/>
No need to worry. It's probably for one of two simple reasons. Read on and we'll launch you back 

into cyberspace in no time:<br/>
<br/>
PrePay Customers.<br/>
1. Have you run out of top-up credit?<br/>
You might be seeing this page if you have no top-up credit left. You can check, for free, using 

My3 Account in Planet3 bookmarks. See "My Account Balance". Any credit you have will be shown 

under "Cash Credits".<br/>
<br/>
What to do:<br/>
If you do need credit, you can buy it online. Go to the "Topping Up" section on 

my3account.three.ie where you'll be asked to register your debit or credit card to buy a 

top-up.<br/>
If you prefer, you can buy your credit in a Three store, or anywhere you see the top-up sign, and 

you'll be good to go.<br/>
<br/>
BillPay Customers.<br/>
1. You have reached your monthly credit limit until your next bill date.
If you'd like to continue using the internet, you can make an interim bill payment by calling 

1913 free, from any Irish landline or dial +353 83 333 333. You will then be able to use this 

service, at out of bundle rates, until your next bill date.<br/>
<br/>
2. Data Roaming is turned off in My3<br/>
Go to "My Roaming Settings" section in My3 to set the roaming you'd like. Remember any usage 

abroad is not included in your monthly price plan and will be charged.<br/>
<br/>
3. Still having problems?<br/>
Don't worry, just give us a call on 1913 from any Irish landline or dial +353 83 333 333 and 

we'll be happy to help.<br/>
